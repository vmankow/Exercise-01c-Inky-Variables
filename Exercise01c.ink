One night, you are awaken from deep slumber to the sound of screeching tires outside. You go to look out the window, only to discover a group of men rushing inside your house.

+ [ fight back ] -> fight 
+ [succumb] -> succumb

== fight ==
You kick and punch with all of your energy. You hear one of the men scream. Good, I might have a chance, you think to yourself. This thought is soon halted when you feel a stabbing pain in your left thigh. Warmth trickles down your leg. Your thoughts subside and your eyes become heavy.

-> dime_search

== dime_search == 
You scower the cave for a dime size coin. After what seems like hours, you have no luck. All seems to be failing until you notice that the slot has a message written on it. It says: Tiny and round, lost in the ground, light in weight, I am a treasure to be found, Shiny and small, in pockets I hide, I am often kept by your side. You think about what this might mean. Ground! That's it, you will look at the ground. As you search the floor, you find a pair of overalls. Pockets! You search the pockets. In the back right pocket, you are thrilled to find a shiny dime sized coin.
